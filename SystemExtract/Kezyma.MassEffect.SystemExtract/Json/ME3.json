Despite massive pressure, its core has failed to ignite in a fusion reaction, qualifying it as a failed star. It is believed to have captured all other planet-sized bodies in the solar system as moons or in impact events, leading to its name, Devourer. Not intimidated by this phenomena, the geth have colonized many of Ammut's moons and skim the hydrogen from Ammut's upper atmosphere.\n\nTRAVEL ADVISORY: Ammut is in geth space.
